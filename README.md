# âš¡ Real-time Neutral Conductor Breakage Detection
**Smart India Hackathon 2025 â€“ Team KANYARAASHI**

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
In low-voltage power distribution, the **neutral conductor** plays a vital role in balancing voltages.  
If the neutral breaks, it can cause:
- Unbalanced voltages  
- Damage to electrical equipment  
- Fire hazards and safety risks  

This project provides **real-time detection of neutral breakage** using Arduino, ACS712 sensors, and automatic relay disconnection.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- âœ… Continuous monitoring of phase currents  
- âœ… Real-time fault detection  
- âœ… Relay-based disconnection to protect appliances  
- âœ… Audible buzzer alerts  
- âœ… Low-cost, scalable, IoT-ready solution

## ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
- The ACS712 sensors measure current on each phase.  
- If the **neutral current imbalance** exceeds the threshold, the system detects a fault.  
- Relay disconnects supply, and the buzzer alerts the user.  
- Data can be extended to IoT dashboards for remote monitoring.

## ðŸ”¹ Code
Code is available in the [Code/NeutralBreakage.ino](![Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b5c535-62d4-4c41-a928-63e6a7e20bd6)
) file.

## ðŸ”¹ Future Scope
- IoT integration with cloud (MongoDB, dashboards)  
- Predictive algorithms for better fault detection  
- Scalable for industrial applications
